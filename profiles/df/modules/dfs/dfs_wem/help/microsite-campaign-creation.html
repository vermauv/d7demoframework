  <li>
    Scroll down and click on ‘Add visit data to Marketo’

    <blockquote>
    We mentioned earlier than when Jennifer, our end-user, joined the vacation giveaway contest, we were triggering a variety of actions. One of those actions was to send that interaction data to our marketing automation system, in this case Marketo.

    Drupal rules let business users watch for events, filter them with conditional logic, and react to them by manipulating data, communicating with external systems or changing the user’s experience.

    In this case, we’re watching for users to join groups. When they do, we’re collecting some information from Drupal about the user and the content they’re interacting with, then transmitting that data to Marketo as an interesting moment in a multi-touch campaign. For the sake of this demo, we’re also popping up a message on the site to let you know made that data transmission.

    In this demo, we already knew a lot about Jennifer. Drupal’s CRM and marketing automation integration can be used to capture data about anonymous users as well, or be linked to Drupal’s webform management modules to transmit form data directly without programming.
