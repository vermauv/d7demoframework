<ol class="steps">
  <li>
    Visit the homepage of the site as an unauthenticated user (be sure you are not logged in before the demo begins).   

    <blockquote>For our demo we’ll be looking at a fictitious Travel interest community, World Travel Nexus.  Nexus is a site that uses community and rich content to drive travel package sales. This is the default view of the homepage from someone just arriving at the site for the first time.</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    Scroll down the page and explain that the layout of the page is the default for a non-authenticated user and note that the content is a mixture of content.

    <blockquote>We can see that the site features a mix of content about travel to vacation destinations around the world.</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    Now log in as the user <strong>JenniferThomson</strong> (password: <strong>password</strong>). Note that as an authenticated user, the content of the homepage changes to reflect her unique personalization attributes based on the information in her customer profile. 

    <blockquote>However, if we log in as community member, Jennifer Thomson, we see that the layout and content mix on the page changes.  
    The page is now tailored to Jennifer who prefers to travel to warmer climates, so the items about Europe have been removed and replaced with content she’ll be more interested in. 
    Drupal’s metadata architecture lets site owners react to contextual information like user profile data and present the right content for individual users.</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    Click on ‘my account’ in upper right of the top nav. 
    <img src="&path&/images/my-account.png" alt="My Account" />

    <ul>
      <li>Take a moment to describe Jennifer’s persona: an end user who wants interesting and relevant content, looking to evaluate products and easily navigate the site.</li>
      <li>Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and point out that the reason Miami was highlighted is because she listed ‘tropical’ as an interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Jennifer has listed ‘tropical’ as one of her areas of interest, so her experience on the site reflects that preference.  
    Drupal is a great system for delivering dynamic, personalized content that allows brands to generate new demand for their product and services by serving up highly-targeted content to individuals.
    Drupal can handle both <strong>implicit and explicit personalization</strong>.
    <strong>Explicit</strong> is what the user tells the organization about him or herself, and <strong>implicit</strong> is based on the actions the person performs on the site.</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    Return to the homepage and note that a contest relevant to her is now shown. Click ”Win a Tropical Caribbean Vacation”
    <img src="&path&/images/win-tropical-vacation.png" alt="Win Tropical Vacation" />
  </li>

  <li>
    Click “Enter this contest” on the next page.
    <ul>
      <li>In response the system shows a message that she has entered the contest.</li>
      <li>At the bottom of the page, she’ll now see content created by people that have also entered the contest.</li>
      <li>Given the right audience, this can serve as an example of organizing around corporate social responsibility issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Drupal gives you many ways to create interactions with and between users. 
    This one-click contest entry is deceptively simple. 
    What we’re actually doing here is adding Jennifer to an organic group. 
    She’s identified herself with another cohort, and now we can show her content that’s been created by others in that cohort, to drive deeper interaction.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>A marketing manager can easily spin up a contest like this, on their own, without having to rely on or wait for IT to do it for them.  
    Marketing users can also further leverage Drupal’s event-driven nature to trigger actions - in this case, sending data to Marketo’s marketing automation suite to drive lead scoring.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>There’s a third action being triggered by Jennifer’s interest in this contest - we’re now presenting a promotion to her based on the affinities we’ve been able to capture. In this case, the promo is for a featured vacation package. Let’s take a look.</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    On the sidebar, she sees a related vacation package.
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the “Tropical Paradise at Reasonable Rates” vacation and add to cart.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Drupal offers a unified platform for content, community, AND commerce which allows marketers to embed rich content into the shopping experience for transformative shopping sites which help inspire a purchase.  Drupal commerce also plugs into a variety of social commerce systems.  You utilize Drupal for a transformative, seamless front-end experience in concert with your existing ecommerce back-end.  Toggling between product pages and shopping cart experience looks like the same experience.  The user has no idea they’re on two different sites.  This inspires action and conversion.</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    Go to checkout and note that, for the sake of a demo, we won't purchase this vacation. 
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the item from your cart by clicking ‘view cart’ and then ‘remove’.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>One month later...
    Now let’s fast forward one month and Jennifer has returned from her trip to Puerto Rico 
    She wants to write a review of her vacation. 
    She can do this from her desktop, or use Drupal’s extensive support for responsive design to author a review from her smartphone.</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    Return to the "Tropical Paradise at Reasonable Rates" page (/content/tropical-paradise-reasonable-rates).
    <ul>
      <li>Activate the responsive design bookmarklet and switch to a phone portrait view. Scroll through the reviews.</li>
      <li>Click on "Write your own review"</li>
      <li>Fill out a fake product review for the vacation.  “Great trip at a great price; highly recommended!” or something similarly simple.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>One of Drupal’s strengths is enabling users to deliver content into their site, allowing companies to infuse social into every aspect of their web experience.  
    Sites set up in this way can help gather product or service requirements by way of  these digital focus groups.  
    This review which Jennifer enters will be moderated automatically by Acquia’s content quality service, Mollom.  
    If you need the ability to moderate across multiple sites, Mollom’s hosted moderation service features enhanced moderator productivity tools and features such as built-in “report-as-inappropriate” capability so managers can unpublish content or block users quickly and easily across networks of sites.</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    Once the review is posted, you are redirected back to the "Tropical Paradise at Reasonable Rates" page where you can see your review.
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the "Share" button then connect a Twitter account and share all in one popup.  </li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Create more personalized links to services and more personalized storytelling channels for products and services with seamless links to fans on Facebook and Twitter.</blockquote>
