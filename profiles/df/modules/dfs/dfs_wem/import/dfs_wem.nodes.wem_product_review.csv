I'll be back.,"Wonderful hotel, stayed 3 nights, lovely room, great beds made for a good nights sleep after a long day! Good hotel service,reception staff always friendly & helpful! Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone for business or family, good transport links via Victoria line, and hotel is very close to King's Cross station.",Travel to London for Less,,EmilyPhillips,b8845900-b544-41ff-a609-5912cd473966,1393303272
Return Visitor,"I've stayed here three separate times with good reason.  The price is right (in a famously expensive city!), it's close to the financial district, and (and this is no small factor), the rooms manage to block out the noise of the traffic outside.  I have had some bad night's sleep in central London hotels on account of the noise, but these rooms are nice and quiet.  After an international flight with 3 days of meetings in front of you, that makes a big difference.  Wifi is so-so, but it is a hotel, after all!",Travel to London for Less,,EricaWebb,e6db015a-82eb-4bca-8354-30fe925da496,1392360300
We never would've found this place on our own.,"This is why I love Nexus: the staff manages to unearth some hidden hotel gems, and this is one such example.  I'd have never thought to look for a place in this neighborhood, but my wife and I loved it.  There are of course, plenty of pubs in London, but the one attached to the hotel is actually quite good.  Great food (the ploughman's is tasty, but they have plenty more that's worth trying), and the landlord is a very funny guy.  We literally talked to him for hours.  I can't wait to go back.  Thanks for helping us find one of our favorite places, Nexus! ",Travel to London for Less,,PaulSimon,1edc239c-87e1-447f-ac93-9304fa40877f,1391000341

Paradise indeed!,"<p>For a start, given the deal we got through Nexus, I was not expecting the service level we received.  Free shuttle from the airport, staffed by a very friendly (hilarious, actually) local, who made it her mission to get us out of our city mindset and onto ""island time"" during the 15 minute drive to the hotel.  In retrospect, this really set the perfect tone for the week.  By the time we arrived at the lobby, (greeted with rum punch cocktails!), I had pushed aside my cares for what was happening back in the world.  As a result of this small gesture, my wife and I got right into maxing and relaxing and turned off the mobiles.</p><p>We actually had very simple requirements for our resort: affordable, no kids (sorry, parents!), and good beach location.  We were looking to log some serious chaise lounge time on a beautiful beach, and that's exactly what we got.  Service at these resorts can be a mixed bag, but we found the staff here to be generally very attentive and friendly.  They'd come around periodically to check in on you, see if you needed a drink (or another!), offer a towel, and even snacks.  Facilities and food were very good, but the staff went the extra mile and that made all the difference for us.</p><p>Oh yeah, beautiful beach too.</p>",Tropical Paradise at Reasonable Rates,,TomCasey,714f0930-7f07-4ab9-a05c-a1a98e8e03e5,1383194684
It Has a Lot of Positives,"Breakfast buffet was definitely one of them.  The swim-up bar in one of the pools was another, and the room size was very good as well.  What we didn't like was how raucous things could get around the pool at night.  It's fine if staying up past midnight is your thing, but we would have liked to be able to get to sleep a little earlier.  The other side of that coin is that you pretty much have the place to yourself until 9am, and we never had to wait for breakfast as a result.",Tropical Paradise at Reasonable Rates,,MelissaBrady,4bd1a386-2314-4409-bbcb-4f3eb23f5420,1381313409
What an awesome adventure!,"Does this resort have a pool you can lounge by all day?  Yes it does.  Did we use it for that?  No, no we did not.  Well, not until the end of the day anyway.  There are so many options here for active people it seemed a shame not to take advantage.  Snorkeling and scuba diving among various reefs is a quick moped ride away.  Deep sea fishing charters were easily arranged by the concierge.  You can literally just grab a Hobie Cat from the beach attendant and take it out into the bay for as long as you like.  The beach streteches for miles and is great for shell collectors.  There's a zip line course less than a mile away...on and on.  Sure the pool is beautiful and we could've enjoyed just the sound of the waves, but it seemed a shame to do it.  This resort's location is close to it all.",Tropical Paradise at Reasonable Rates,,StephenDay,e4a2988e-b391-43cf-9057-6632e8dbc7f9,1378062061
We thought we were in a movie.,"The interiors of the resort rooms and facilities are straight out of ""Dr. No"".  Classic British-inspired Carribean architecture.  Louvered doors, ceiling fans, thatched roofs on the bungalows, and a calypso band played every night by the pool to accompany each magnificent sunset over the bay.  The only thing missing was Puss Feller slinging rum drinks behind the bar!  Loved it, and we'll be back.  ",Tropical Paradise at Reasonable Rates,,PaulSimon,3aec1583-e889-4678-8dd4-53983c5b0ba8,1373942013
The reef is lovely...,"Great reef here with sections for beginners and experts alike.  A dazzling variety of fish, and corals including some I've never seen before.  There's a ship wreck a mile out as well for those feeling a bit more adventurous.  We were able to get a charter out with little difficulty.  Word of caution though:  there are morays on the reef, so don't go sticking your hand into any crevices!",Tropical Paradise at Reasonable Rates,,EricaWebb,05732154-6d9f-49d6-8cec-597308021cf6,1370066498

Views and Weather are Incredible,"Whether it was by the pool or on the balcony of my hotel room, the views were incredible. I got up to watch the sun rise every morning and the views were beautiful. This hotel was perfect for getting work done, but not making it feel like work.

Amenities make it hard to leave your room!,"I spent a lot of time in my room doing work, but whenever I needed anything from the hotel staff, they rushed it up as soon as they could. With free wifi, great tv stations to choose from and a comfy bed, it was hard to leave my room. A few times my wifi lost signal or I ran out of towels but as soon as I made the call downstairs, someone was in my room addressing the problem, making sure i was satisfied before they left.",Make This Your New Office,,EricaWebb,cdbeaf38-115e-4696-ab38-76229e383c0c,1392360300
Free wifi!,"Free wifi, need i say more? It's so hard to go to a majestic business desitnation like Sydney and find this as a hotel offering. It saved me a ton of money and time, and helped me enjoy the views a little bit more. There was more than one password on multiple network domains in case for some reason you couldn't connect. It's that time of business service that makes me want to return here in the future.",Make This Your New Office,,PaulSimon,75d3daf6-a667-45e7-be07-e428b58bcd0e,1391000341
I got more work done here,"The amount of work I was able to complete was immense. My company held their annual conference here and it was the most productive outing I have been a part of. With that many smart people collaborating in an environment that on encourages that, it was hard not to call the trip a success. Anything we needed, we got. If a projector wasnt working or we needed an extra chair, you just needed to look around and someone was already taking care of it. This was true professionalism that helped me do my job better.",Make This Your New Office,,TomCasey,233e3f76-202d-46d6-9341-2fe6c2a6bd9f,1383194684
Stunning historical attractions,"Even though I was here on business, I wanted to make sure I took in all Sydney had to offer.

I even got to see the famous Sydney Opera House.",Make This Your New Office,,MelissaBrady,ed8e2dc0-c444-49af-bc20-bfd5952d6508,1381313409
Very impressed,"When I was told I was being sent here on business I really had minimal expectations, simply because I had never been to Australia before. Boy was I impressed. Probably the friendliest people ever, and was eager to lend advice or directions whenever I needed it. I never felt like a tourist, but rather greeted by so many people that wanted me to see what their city had to offer. The views, attractions, and hotel experience were all above par.

Will be returning soon!,"Sydney was all that I thought it was going to be, and more. The hotel even had a day where for a few hours we could get a discounted rate to the local zoo to check out some kangaroos and other animals. It was great. my work conference was incredible, as the staff was extremely accomodating and helpful. The hotel food was great too. And best of all, free wifi with stunning views.

"Close to the airport, great rental car deals","The closeness to the local airport was really awesome. I didn't feel rushed on my last day, and was able to feel relaxed until the very end of my stay. The hotel even partnered with a rental car service to make sure that if we needed to rent a car, the rates were affordable and even welcoming. It made coming here for business extremely convenient and worthwhile.",Make This Your New Office,,EricaWebb,469a2886-4148-4554-a151-9eff805b2910,1370066498

"Family fun, to an extent","I brought my husband and two teenage boys here on vacation and wasn't thoroughly impressed. There was enough to do with great views and attractions, but there wasn't a lot we could do with them.

The kids had just as much fun as me,"My kids had so much fun on our family vacation. They spent the days at the beach and pool, nights at the acquarium or theme parks. I had just as much fun as they did, which is very rare in our family.

Weather was spotty,"Sydney has some of the best weather to offer when it cooperates. Every day was tropical, but not too humid. It did rain a lot when I was there but weather is something you can't predict. My advice would be to carry an umbrella or two when it rains because when it rains it comes down in buckets.",Stunning Views in Sydney,,PaulSimon,01d31025-aa16-4f89-a310-8a8843c0cabc,1391000341
Tons of attractions!,"I never knew how many things there were to do in Syndey besides the beach, views and great food! There were parks, acquariums, zoos and even the Famous Sydney Opera House.

Bring your patience,"Because there are so many wonderful attractions and things to do in Sydney, it's a tourist hotbed and if you don't bring your patience it will not be enjoyable. I needed to remember that everyone was there for the same reaosn I was, which was to get away from their normal lives and see some truly majestic views. Sydney is a beautiful city and the accomodations of the local cuisine and hotels only enhance that. But everyone else knows that too, so be patient when you're out and about because lines will be long and traffic will be bad.",Stunning Views in Sydney,,TomCasey,d1008f61-f024-4fa2-a984-70eab61af951,1383194684
Great getaway destination,"I'm a big beach and surf person and Sydney was the best destination to do both. Waves were always incredicle and the weather to compliment that was perfect. I surfed all day, every day that I was there and the locals were great at giving me some tips and advice. I even learned some new moves that the surfers by my hotel had to share. Then they invited me to hang out with them at night. Truly an awesome experience!",Stunning Views in Sydney,,MelissaBrady,fa4b2465-00d3-452c-aa7f-f5b56d79eb4f,1381313409

Nicest hotel staff I've seen!,"As soon as I got out of the cab to walk to the hotel, I was met by a member of the staff who took my bags and helped me find my room. While in the elevator he told me all of the great restaurants, attractions and social hotspots Luxor had to offer. He even let me know the hotel pool and hot tub hours.
